In this case, the solution does not satisfy the Bellman equation. Our approach consists of studying a recursive Lagrangian. Under standard general conditions, there is a recursive functional equation (analogous to a Bellman equation) that characterizes a recursive solution to the planner's problem. The recursive formulation is obtained after adding a co‐state variable summarizing previous commitments reflected in past Lagrange multipliers. The continuation problem is obtained with playing the role of weights in the objective function. Our approach is applicable to characterizing and computing solutions to a large class of dynamic contracting problems.},

We show that such dual problems can be recursively decomposed with costates (i.e., Lagrange multipliers on laws of motion) functioning as state variables. In dynamic contracting and policy settings, the method often replaces an endogenous state space of forward‐looking utilities with an exogenously given state space of costates. We provide a principle of optimality for dual problems and give conditions under which the dual Bellman operator is a contraction with the optimal dual value function its unique fixed point. We relate economic problems to their duals, address computational issues, and give examples.},

By altering the terms of the marital contract, these legal changes impacted the incentives for women to enter and remain in the labor force. Whereas earlier work suggests that the impact of unilateral divorce on female employment depends critically on laws governing property division, I show that these results are not robust to alternative specifications and controls. I find, instead, that unilateral divorce led to an increase in both married and unmarried female labor force participation, regardless of the preexisting laws regarding property division.},

For each death, 20 times as many mothers suffered pregnancy-related conditions, which made it hard for them to engage in market work. Between 1930 and 1960 there was a remarkable improvement in maternal health. We argue that this development, by enabling women to reconcile work and motherhood, was essential for the joint rise in women’s labor force participation and fertility over this period. We also show that the diffusion of infant formula played an important auxiliary role.},
